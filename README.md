# Amazon Clone üöÄ

This is an amazing, fully functional responsive built with Next js, Tailwind CSS, Lottie Files and React Slick. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
Lottie is an open-source animation file format that‚Äôs tiny, high quality, scriptable,
interactive, and can be manipulated at runtime. The top 500 apps on the App
store now use Lottie to engage users and enhance conversions. React Slick helps to create Responsive 'Carousels' for your React/Next project.

## Getting Started

First, run the yarn to add the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
